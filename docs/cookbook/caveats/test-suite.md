Running the Test Suite
======================

Both projects have a set of Unit, Functional and Behavioral tests. It is important
to know how to run them all, and how to do that in a fast way

## elcodi/elcodi

Running the test suite for elcodi/elcodi is simply one command:

``` bash
php bin/phpunit
```

Elcodi tests are ran against folder `/tmp/Elcodi`, so a good practice in this
case is to ensure that accesses to this folder are fast enough. For this reason, we can
create a `tmpfs`, a mounted file system stored in volatile memory instead of a 
persistent storage device.

``` bash
rm -Rf /tmp/Elcodi
sudo mkdir /tmp/Elcodi
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=512M tmpfs /tmp/Elcodi/
```

With this trick, your tests will run extremely faster than before.

Elcodi project uses as well a Testing Booster called
[FixturesBoosterBundle](https://github.com/elcodi/FixturesBoosterBundle). This
project overwrites the Doctrine command `doctrine:fixtures:load` with a boosted
version.

In order to avoid keeping state on a temporal database you may need to remove 
temporal files generated by this booster on your tmp folder:

``` bash
rm -rf /tmp/*.backup.database
```

## elcodi/bamboo

Running the test suite for elcodi/bamboo is also simple:

``` bash
php bin/behat
php bin/phpunit -c app/
```

As explained before, Bamboo tests also can be ran against a `tmpfs` unit.

``` bash
rm -Rf /tmp/Bamboo
sudo mkdir /tmp/Bamboo
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=512M tmpfs /tmp/Bamboo
```

You can do the same with the cache folder, in order to make all reads really 
faster.

``` bash
rm -Rf app/cache
mkdir app/cache
sudo mkdir /tmp/Bamboo
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=512M tmpfs /tmp/cache
```
