## Ask your cookbook

Of course, we cannot think about all problems a project can produce. And this is
because there are a lot of possible scenarios you fill find yourself lost and
with some helping needs.

Don't worry. Do you need how to do something that is not documented yet? Ask us
and we will take care of all these things:

* Helping you with that problem on Gitter. Please, join us at
[elcodi/elcodi room](http://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi) and ask us whatever you
need.
* Adding the cookbook entry with the "How to..." text
* If the problem is common, we will create a new blog post explaining the
solution

## Add your cookbook entry

Have you solved something interesting? Then, we are interested in knowing what
did you solve and how did you do that.

You can propose your new material by following the
[Pull Request Book chapter](../book/pull-requests.md). If you need some help
about how to do that, we can improve as well this chapter in order to make it
more clear and easy.
