# Why Elcodi

In this chapter we will show you how Elcodi can fulfill your project needs, by
explaining you our strength and weakness, and by listing you some points you
can explain to the business department.

## Strength

* The project is Symfony based. This can be hard at the beginning if your team
is not ready for Symfony, but is a great opportunity for your company to start
growing as a technological company by using the spectacular framework.
* The project started with one single focus: to solve the E-commerce problem by
using a simple but complex base.
* The project is created and accurately maintained by developers for developers. 
This means that our focus is not only de business layer, but the technical layer
as well.
* The project is developer friendly, so E-commerce projects will not a pain 
anymore.
* The project follows a scalable architecture. Your development resources will
not increment at all with the time. This means less time and more money to spend
in your own domain (what really matters)
* The project is built on top of open source, so the community will support you
in all your problems and doubts.
* The project have been free from the beginning and until the end, using a very
open [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
* The project is alive. This means that will become better day by day, using
a very strict [versioning model](http://semver.org/).
* You company will acquire a community-based culture. You will find 
* The project's company, Elcodi Networks, is focused only in making the project
bigger day by day, providing exclusive open source support. You'll never be
alone.
* We are other projects friendly. Many integrations with other projects will be
available for you! We will fight hard for that!
* Elcodi core team is ready for you to join them. Say hello in
[Gitter's Elcodi room](http://gitter.im/elcodi/elcodi) and let them helping you
with your project!

## Weaknesses

* The project is young. This means that we've been working so hard on our core
and philosophy. This means as well that we have the power to do everything as we
wish and as good as we can.
* The project's community is not big enough. Well, which one was big at the 
beginning?
* The project's plugin and template repository is not big enough. This base will 
grow with the time, so this is only about making the project bigger and bigger,
and the repository will automatically grow with us
